# game-interactivity-study
Android apk exploring the most fundamental aspects of play. Features a wordless, minimallistic, yet expresive UI.

There are 4 buttons in the main menu:
1. Reaction time with a single option: When the brighter line starts to expand, quickly tap anywhere in the screen. The full screen will display your reaction time. If you tap before it starts to expand, you will be penalized by having to wait for a random, longer amount of time for the next attempt.
2. Reaction time with two options: When one of the 2 sides gets brighter, quickly tap it. The full screen will display your reaction time. If you tap the wrong side, you will be penalized by having to wait for a random, longer amount of time for the next attempt.
3. Precision: A dot appears in a random location in the screen, and the more precisely you tap its center, the smaller the number in the full screen will be. It appears again after some time.
4. About this app: shows the name of the studio that built it

To get out of any of the modes, slide your finger through the screen in any direction until you are in the main menu.
